Feature Extraction
In order to extract basic image features we used the Protosc toolbox. The data set contained a total of 142 images from 2 categories. Prior to feature extraction, RGB values were converted to CIELAB. Using the Viola-Jones algorithm (Viola & Jones, 2001), Protosc located the face area and took the area annotated as the face plus an additional 20% as the new image. 

Feature Selection Methods
To test if there are features of the images that have predictive value concerning the category to which an image belongs, we used the Protosc feature selection approach. The approach uses 10-fold cross validation where in each fold four models are trained on a one part of data and tested on separate part of the data. The four models are based on different methods of selection: a filter approach, a wrapper approach, a random selection and a pseudo random selection (which selects a random set of features of the pool of features not selected by the current filter or wrapper approach). To estimate a distribution of chance performance, for each fold and for each methodâ€™s selection of features, 25 models are trained and tested based on shuffled category labels. The result is a distribution of 1000 values forming a distribution of chance performances. Prior to feature selection, highly correlated features were grouped together and in or excluded together during the feature selection process.
