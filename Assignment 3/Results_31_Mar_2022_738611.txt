Results

Feature selection results show 3 out of the 75 possible features are associated with performances that exceed the maximum chance performance, corresponding to a p-value smaller than 0.001 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons). This means these features have significant predictive value over the category the images belongs to. To test if any of the feature selection approaches consistently resulted in above chance performance, the accuracies of the four approaches were compared to the distribution of chance performances. To correct for multiple comparisons, the criterion for significance was set at 0.01. Inspecting the performances per approach we find non-significant performance for the filter-selection approach (p = 0.3238, M: 0.64286, SD: 0.19105). We find non-significant performance for the wrapper-selection approach (p = 0.3942, M: 0.58333, SD: 0.15027). We find non-significant performance for the random-selection approach (p = 0.3178, M: 0.6131, SD: 0.12739). We find non-significant performance for the pseudorandom-selection approach (p = 0.3942, M: 0.57262, SD: 0.082564). The average number of features used for the models was 13.1. Results show that, even though the approach found significant features, none of the feature selection approaches consistently resulted in above chance performance. Note that each approach is free to use a different set of features in each fold of the analysis, which, combined with having difficulty when making a selection, could explain these results.
